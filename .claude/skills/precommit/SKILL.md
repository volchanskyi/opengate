  Run all mandatory pre-commit checks: lints, tests, benchmarks, coverage, and documentation.
  Use before every commit. Blocks commit if any check fails.

# Pre-Commit Checklist

Run ALL lints, ALL tests, test coverage, and ALL benchmarks. No exceptions. All tests MUST pass regardless of having pre-existing issues or being flaky.

## Lints (all must pass)

These lints mirror the CI config-lint job exactly. Every check that runs in CI MUST also run locally.

1. `cd agent && cargo fmt --all -- --check && cargo clippy --workspace -- -D warnings` — Rust format + clippy
2. `cd server && go vet ./...` — Go vet
3. `cd web && npx eslint .` — Web ESLint
4. `~/go/bin/actionlint` — GitHub Actions workflow lint (ALWAYS run locally, no exceptions). Runs with `shellcheck` and `pyflakes` for full parity with CI (both are installed locally).
5. `make lint-deploy` — Deploy config validation (yamllint, terraform, tflint, compose, caddy, trivy, integration tests). This runs all of the following (skips gracefully if a tool is not installed, but all SHOULD be installed for full CI parity):
   - `yamllint -c .yamllint.yml deploy/` — YAML lint on deploy configs
   - `terraform -chdir=deploy/terraform fmt -check -recursive` — Terraform format check
   - `terraform -chdir=deploy/terraform init -backend=false && terraform -chdir=deploy/terraform validate` — Terraform validation
   - `tflint --init --chdir=deploy/terraform && tflint --chdir=deploy/terraform --format=compact` — Terraform linting
   - `docker compose config --quiet` (production, staging, test) — Docker Compose validation
   - `caddy fmt --diff` + `caddy validate` on both Caddyfiles — Caddyfile validation
   - `trivy config --severity HIGH,CRITICAL --exit-code 1 deploy/` + Dockerfile — IaC security scan
   - `bash deploy/tests/validate-configs.sh` — Cross-config consistency tests (ports, env vars, tfvars)

## Codegen sync (must pass)

6. `PATH="$HOME/go/bin:$PATH" make verify-codegen` — Verify OpenAPI generated code is in sync. This MUST actually run (not skip). If it prints "SKIP", install the tool first: `go install github.com/oapi-codegen/oapi-codegen/v2/cmd/oapi-codegen@v2.6.0`. A "SKIP" is a FAILURE — do not proceed to commit.

## Tests (all must pass)

7. `cd server && go test -race -timeout 5m ./...` — Go tests (unit + integration, race detector)
8. `cd agent && cargo test --workspace` — Rust tests (all crates)
9. `cd web && npx vitest run` — Web tests

## E2E tests (all must pass)

10. `make e2e` — Playwright E2E tests (spins up docker-compose.test.yml, runs all specs, tears down). Requires Docker running.

## Security audit (must pass)

11. `cd web && npm audit --audit-level=high` — npm dependency vulnerability scan

## Benchmarks (all must run without errors)

12. `cd server && go test -bench=. -benchmem -run='^$' ./internal/...` — Go benchmarks
13. `cd agent && cargo bench -p mesh-protocol` — Rust benchmarks

## Documentation (mandatory on every commit)

14. **`README.md`** (root) — If the commit changes anything covered by existing README sections (commands, setup, architecture, etc.), update those sections to stay accurate. Do NOT add new sections.
15. **GitHub Wiki** — Update the relevant wiki pages to reflect all changes. The wiki is the primary reference for senior engineers — it must be comprehensive, accurate, and always in sync with the codebase. Add new pages or sections as needed when introducing new features, APIs, or architectural changes.

## Gate Criteria

Do NOT commit if:
- Any lint fails
- Any test fails (unit, integration, or E2E)
- New code coverage is below 80% or overall coverage below 70%
- Any benchmark errors out
- Any security audit fails (high+ severity vulnerabilities)
- Documentation is stale
